# Task 1:
- The program takes input 2 numbers stored in variables `a` & `b`.
- It then performs basic mathematical operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the two numbers and stores them in variables `addition`, `subtraction`, `mulltiplication` and `division`.
- The results which are stored in these variables are then displayed on the output terminal.

# Task 2:
- The program takes input 2 strings stored in variables `first_name` and `last_name`, asking for the user's first and last names.
- It then concatenates the 2 strings to another string variable, `full_name`.
- A greeting is then printed on the output terminal, referring to the user by their full name.
